# supabase

## Purpose

The three Supabase client constructors, each scoped to the `paykit` schema
and to one specific execution context — client component, server
(session-scoped), and middleware. Getting the wrong one in the wrong
context is either a build error (browser APIs on the server) or an RLS
bypass (service client where a session client belongs), so the split is
deliberate.

## Contents

- `client.ts` — `createClient()`: browser client for Client Components,
  built with `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_*` (publishable key, RLS-enforced).
- `server.ts` — `createServerClient()`: session-scoped server client
  (cookie-backed via `next/headers`, RLS-enforced) for Server Components/
  Actions/Route Handlers acting as the signed-in vendor.
  `createServiceClient()`: service-role client that **bypasses RLS** —
  only for Server Actions/Route Handlers that must act across vendors
  (the `/api/v1/*` cross-kit API, admin-style reads). Never import this
  into a client component.
  Both are generic over `Database`/`"paykit"` (see `@/lib/types`).
- `middleware.ts` — `updateSession(request)`: refreshes the Supabase
  session cookie and redirects unauthenticated requests to `/dashboard/*`
  (`isProtectedPath`) to `/login`. Called from `src/proxy.ts`.

## Connectivity

`proxy.ts` calls `updateSession` on every request. Server Components/
Actions call `createServerClient`/`createServiceClient`; Client Components
call `createClient`.
